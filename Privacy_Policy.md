# Privacy Policy
PingBot

## 1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how PingBot collects, uses, and stores data. By using PingBot, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.

PingBot is operated by **The PingBot Team**.  
For support, visit: https://discord.gg/ffJNStGpy9

## 2. Data We Collect
PingBot only collects the data necessary to create and deliver reminders. This includes:

- Discord user ID  
- Username  
- Discord guild (server) ID  
- Discord channel ID  
- Optional reminder message (if provided)  
- Timestamp of creation  
- Scheduled reminder time

No additional personal information is collected. PingBot does not track user behavior, messages outside of reminders, or any data unrelated to the reminder functions.

## 3. How We Use the Data
Collected data is used exclusively to:

- Store reminders  
- Schedule reminder events  
- Send pings or messages at the requested times  
- Allow users to manage or delete their reminders

PingBot does not use the data for analytics, advertising, or profiling.

## 4. Data Sharing
PingBot does **not** sell, share, or transfer your data to third parties.  
Data is only accessed internally by the service to operate the bot.

We do not provide data to server administrators beyond what Discord normally displays (such as usernames or message content you choose to submit in reminders).

## 5. Data Storage and Retention
Reminder data is stored in a database so that PingBot can function correctly.

Data is kept only as long as the reminder exists. When a user deletes a reminder or it is delivered, the associated data is removed from the database.

We aim to keep data storage minimal and only for the duration needed.

## 6. User Control
Users can:

- Create reminders  
- Delete reminders  
- Modify or update reminders (if supported by bot commands)

Deleting a reminder permanently removes the stored data associated with it.

## 7. Children’s Privacy
PingBot follows Discord’s age requirements. Users must meet Discord’s minimum age to use the service. PingBot does not knowingly store data for users under this age.

## 8. Security
We take reasonable steps to protect stored data.  
However, no system is completely secure. By using PingBot, you acknowledge that data transmission and storage always carry some risk.

## 9. Changes to This Policy
The PingBot Team may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Continued use of PingBot after updates are posted will indicate your acceptance of the revised policy.
