/ping <time> [message] [snooze]
Create a reminder.
- Time formats: 10s, 5m, 2h, 1d
- message is optional
- snooze is optional: active or inactive

Examples:
- /ping 3d Take out the trash active
- /ping 30m Check the oven

When a reminder fires:
- The bot sends: <message_link>: @you (so the mention always pings)
- If snooze is active, footer shows: PingBot - Active Snooze
- If a message was set, it appears in the embed

Active snooze auto-repeat (if you do nothing):
- after 10 minutes
- then 1 hour
- then 3 hours
- then every 24 hours
- auto-stops after 7 days

Snooze controls on reminder message:
- Don't snooze: stop future repeats
- Dropdown: 1 hour, 24 hours, 48 hours (manual reschedule)
