PingBot

Last updated: (add date)

## 1. Introduction
PingBot is a Discord bot that allows users to create reminders that will ping them at a specified time. By using PingBot, you agree to these Terms of Service.

These terms are operated by **The PingBot Team**.

## 2. Use of the Service
PingBot allows users to request reminders through commands. The bot will only send messages or pings when a user explicitly requests it. Using the bot indicates that you consent to receiving such reminder messages.

You must comply with Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines at all times. Users must meet Discord’s minimum age requirement.

There are no additional restrictions beyond normal and reasonable use. Abuse, exploitation, or attempts to disrupt the service may result in loss of access.

## 3. Data Collected
To function properly, PingBot stores reminder information in a database. This includes:
- Discord user ID  
- Username  
- Discord guild (server) ID  
- Discord channel ID  
- Optional reminder message (if provided)  
- Timestamp of creation  
- Scheduled reminder time

This data is used only to deliver reminders that the user has created. PingBot does not collect other personal information or track users outside of these necessary fields.

## 4. Data Usage
Collected data is used exclusively to schedule, manage, and deliver reminder pings. Data is not sold, shared, or used for any secondary purpose.

Users may delete reminders by using the provided bot commands. Removing a reminder permanently deletes its associated data.

## 5. Service Availability
PingBot may experience downtime, maintenance, or unexpected issues that prevent reminders from being delivered.

**PingBot is provided as is. We are not responsible for missed reminders, downtime, lost data, or any damages resulting from use of the bot.**

Use of the service is at your own discretion.

## 6. Changes to the Terms
The PingBot Team may update these Terms of Service at any time. Continued use of PingBot after changes are posted will constitute acceptance of the updated terms.
